# What this repo. is for?

This repo. has **parallelized** :lightning: :fire: code utilities for preprocessing pipeline of any face recognition dataset.


# What it can do?

It does following:

 - assigns labels to identities in parallel, optimized fashion and makes a csv file with "image", "identity" and "label" columns    
 - face detection :panda_face:
 - face aligning (image is rotated + scaled to make line joining eyes, horizontal :traffic_light: then it is scaled to a standard face)
 - resizing of images to some size defined by the user :man-gesturing-ok:
